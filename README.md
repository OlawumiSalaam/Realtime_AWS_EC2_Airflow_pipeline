# Realtime_AWS_EC2_Airflow_pipeline
This project demonstrates the creation of an automated ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow on an AWS EC2 instance. The pipeline extracts real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API, performs transformations, and loads the processed data into an Amazon S3 bucket for storage and further analysis.
